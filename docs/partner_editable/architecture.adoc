image::../images/dotnetfx-ecs-cicd-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* AWS CodePipeline to create a pipeline with source, build, and deploy stages. The pipeline is invoked when a developer commits a code change to the configured GitHub repository branch. 
* An Amazon S3 bucket to store pipeline artifacts.
* AWS CodeBuild to build the source code into a new Docker container image. AWS CodeBuild connects to AWS Systems Manager, which automates the following build tasks:
** Retrieves code from Amazon S3.
** Provisions a temporary Amazon EC2 instance in the default virtual private cloud (VPC).
** Builds a new Docker container image from the source code. 
** Publishes the new Docker container image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR).
* AWS CodeDeploy to deploy the new Docker container image to Amazon ECS.

//[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
