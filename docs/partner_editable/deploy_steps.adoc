=== Subscribe to the {partner-product-short-name} AMI

This Quick Start requires a subscription to the AMI for {partner-product-short-name} in AWS Marketplace.

. Open the page for the {marketplace_listing_url}[{partner-product-short-name} AMI in AWS Marketplace^], and then choose *Continue to Subscribe*.
. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose *Accept Terms*. +
  A confirmation page loads, and an email confirmation is sent to the account owner. For detailed subscription instructions, see the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470[AWS Marketplace documentation^].

=== Launch the Quick Start
// Adapt the following warning to your Quick Start.
// WARNING: If you’re deploying {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC, ensure that your VPC has two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances and that the subnets are not shared. This Quick Start does not support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets^]. These subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways^] in their route tables to allow the instances to download packages and software without exposing them to the internet. Also ensure that the domain name configuration parameter in DHCP options is configured as explained in http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[DHCP options sets^]. You provide your VPC settings when you launch the Quick Start.

// TODO Does the warning above apply to this QS? I don't see VPC parameters in the quickstart-dotnetfx-ecs-cicd.template.yaml.
