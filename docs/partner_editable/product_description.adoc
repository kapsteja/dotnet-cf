This Quick Start deploys a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud for .NET applications that run on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Your application is updated each time code is changed on your configured GitHub repository branch without interrupting the Amazon ECS service.

AWS CodePipeline creates a pipeline with source, build, and deploy stages. During the source stage, code is retrieved from GitHub and stored on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). In the build stage, AWS CodeBuild and AWS Systems Manager build a new Docker container image of your code on a temporary Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. In the deploy stage, AWS CodeDeploy deploys the updated image to Amazon ECS.
