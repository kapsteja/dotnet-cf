// Add steps as necessary for accessing the software, post-configuration, and testing. Donâ€™t include full usage instructions for your software, but add links to your product documentation for that information.
//Should any sections not be applicable, remove them

== Post-deployment steps
To test your pipeline, do the following:

. Make a code change to your configured source repository, commit, and push the change.
. Open the CodePipeline console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/.
. Choose your pipeline from the list.
. Watch the pipeline progress through its stages. Your pipeline should complete and your Amazon ECS service runs the Docker image that was created from your code change.
. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/[Amazon ECS console^].
. Navigate to the Amazon ECS task updated by the pipeline and expand the container details.
. Open the URL for the application. Confirm that your application sample is deployed.
